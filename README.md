# True-Dynamic-Array-Class-cpp

Implementation of True Dynamic Array Class – Your goal is to implement a generic “DynamicArray" class. This
will allow you to increase the size of the array whenever you want to add another integer to it. You will need to write
three files (DynamicArray.h, DynamicArray.cpp and Q3.cpp). Your implemented class must fully provide the
definitions of following class (interface) functions. Please also write down the test code to drive your class
implementation. Please note that we will be running your code against our test code and any segmentation faults or
incorrect result will result in loss of marks.
